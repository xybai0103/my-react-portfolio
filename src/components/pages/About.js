        I spent my past over ten years in the landscape architecture and Urban Planning area. Serving as 
        a research assistant at the University of Florida, I participated in multi-diciplinary research 
        projects that involve not only urban planning, but also public heath, enginnering, and computer 
        science. During my collaboration and communication with researchers from other areas, I devloped 
        my interest in coding and devloping website applications.

        After graduation, I continued working as a research assistant and learned coding in my spare time.
        I joined the UTSA Coding Bootcamp and Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed
